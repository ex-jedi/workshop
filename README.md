# Starter Files

## Linting Setup

Linting setup courtesy of Wes Bos' [No-Sweatâ„¢ Eslint and Prettier Setup](<https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos#no-sweat-eslint-and-prettier-setup>)

1. If there isn't already have a package.json file, create one with `npm init`.
2. Install everything needed by the config with `npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-wesbos`
3. `.eslintrc` and `prettierrc` are included (you're welcome). They play nicely for the most part but settings are under review to make sure they don't squabble.
4. A `prepros.config` file is included (you're welcome), but go to [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/) if one prefers a nice and simple builder.
5. I should have all settings needed for VS Code, but check the link to Wes' repo up top if you're not me.
6. Make sure the VS Code [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) package is installed, but not Prettier (or there will be war).
7. As I like to push work to main, make a starter branch to begin new work from.
8. Have at it!
