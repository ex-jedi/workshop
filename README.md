# Starter Files

## Linting Setup

Linting setup courtesy of Wes Bos' [No-Sweatâ„¢ Eslint and Prettier Setup](<https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos#no-sweat-eslint-and-prettier-setup>)

1. If you don't already have a package.json file, create one with `npm init`.
2. Install everything needed by the config with `npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-wesbos`
3. `.eslintrc` and `prettierrc` are included (you're welcome). They play nicely for the most part but settings are under review to make sure they don't squabble.
4. A `prepros.config` file is included, but go to [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/) for a nice and simple builder.
